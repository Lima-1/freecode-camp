            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for CSS layout were features like floats and position. These work, but in some ways ther're also limiting and frustrating.</p>
            <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Flexbox_Model">
            <header>Flexbox Model</header>
            <p>When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two axes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The <strong>main axis</strong> is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as a row across the page, or a column down the page.) The start and end of the axis are called the <strong>main start</strong> and <strong>main end</strong></li>
                <li>The <strong>cross axis</strong> is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the <strong>cross start</strong> and <strong>cross end.</strong></li>
                <li>The parent element that haas dispay: flex set on it (the <u>section</u> in our example) is called the flex container.</section></li>
              </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Specifying_Elements_Layout">
            <header>Specifying Elements Layout</header>
            <p>To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid out as flexible boxes. To do this, we set a special value of display on the parent element of the elements you want to affect. In this case we want to lay out the article elemts, so we set this on the section:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    section {
                        display: flex;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This causes the element to become a flex container and its children becomes flex items.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Columns_or_Rows">
            <header>Columns or Rows</header>
            <p>Flexbox provides a property called flex-direction that specifies the main axis  runs(which direction the flexbox children are laid out in).</p>
            <p>By default this is laid out in a row, which causes them to be laid in a row direction in the direction your browser's default language works in (left to right, in the case of English browser).</p>
            <p>Try adding the following declaration to your <u>section</u> rule: </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    flex-direction: column;
                 </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This will put the items back in a column layout, much like they were before we added CSS.</p>

            
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Wrapping">
            <header>Wrapping</header>
            <p>One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow the their container, breking the layout. Have a look at our <u>flexbox0.html</u> example and try <u>viewing it live</u>.</p>
            <p>One way in which you can fix this is to add the followng declaration to your <u>section</u> rule:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    flex-wrap: wrap;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Also, add the following declaration to your <u>article</u> rule:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    flex: 200px;
                </code>
            </pre> 
            <p>there exist a shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap: flex-flow. Example:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    flex-direction: row;
                    flex-wrap: wrap;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>with</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    flex-flow: row wrap;
                </code>
            </pre>
